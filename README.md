# Despoiler

This project was my first attempt at creating a 3D RTS game.

Highlights:
Goal-Oriented AI decision making which was written from scratch \n
Hierarchy of Goal agents. So a Squad does planning to reach an objective or fight, and it sets the priority for its units. The units then run the Goal logic to determine whether they fight, move, or hold their position
